# Docker list containers

This is a simple script to list all containers in a docker host and a basic status in a table.
It's mainly meant to try out the docker client for a different project I want to work on.

## Usage
Install go from [here](https://golang.org/doc/install) and run the following command in the root of the project.
```bash
go run main.go
```

## Install using go
If you want the command to be generally available, you can install it using go from the root of the project.
```bash
go install
```
